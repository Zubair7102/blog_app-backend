        // const { post, user, body } = req.body;: This line uses destructuring to extract the post, user, and body fields from the request body (req.body).

        // { new: true }: This option tells Mongoose to return the updated document rather than the old document before the update.
        .populate("comments") //populate the comments array with comment documents
        // .populate("comments"): After updating the post, this method replaces the comments ID with the actual comment documents.

        // .exec(): This method executes the query. Mongoose queries are not executed immediately; they are defined first and then executed with .exec() or by using await.

// Post.findByIdAndUpdate(post, { $push: { comments: savedComment._id } }, { new: true })
// Post.findByIdAndUpdate(): This is a Mongoose method used to find a document by its ID and update it. In this case, itâ€™s used to find a post by its ID and add a new comment to its comments array.

// post: This is the ID of the post you want to update. It should be the value of the post variable, which is likely a string representing the ObjectId of the post.

// { $push: { comments: savedComment._id } }: This is the update operation.

// $push: This MongoDB operator adds an item to an array field. In this case, it adds the ID of the newly created comment (savedComment._id) to the comments array of the post.
