// mongoose.model():
// This is a Mongoose method that creates a model.
// It takes two main arguments:
// The name of the model (in this case, "Like").
// The schema that defines the structure of the documents in this model (in this case, likeSchema).

// "Like":
// This is the name of your model.
// In MongoDB, Mongoose will automatically create a collection with the pluralized version of this name, so "Like" becomes the "likes" collection in your database.

// likeSchema:
// This is the schema that youâ€™ve defined earlier in your code, which specifies the structure of the documents in the likes collection.
// The schema defines what fields each document will have, the types of those fields, and any other constraints or options.

// module.exports:
// This is a Node.js feature that allows you to export something from a file so that it can be used in other files.
// By exporting the model, you're making it available to be imported and used in other parts of your application.
